This directory contains initialization configuration files used for the
various pieces of the PSHELL package.  It contains information that can
be used to configure various operational parameters for the pshell server,
pshell control, and pshell client subsystems.

The config processing will look for these files in the directory specified
by the $PSHELL_CONFIG_DIR environment variable, and if not found will look
in the default PSHELL_CONFIG_DIR (i.e. /etc/pshell/config).

The following files and their use are described below:

pshell-server.conf:
  This file contains configuration override information for all the PSHELL
  servers configured on a given host.  The config information can be overridden
  on a per-server basis.  See the example file for a list of all the items
  that can be configured.

pshell-client.conf:
  This file is used by the stand-alone 'pshell' UDP/UNIX Client program and the
  pshell.exp telnet 'expect' wrapper script to assign server names to port
  addresses.  This can help in creating named servers without having to memorize
  port numbers.  See the example file for the syntax of specifying port assignments.

pshell-control.conf:
  This file contains configuration override information for all the PSHELL
  control clients configured on a given host.  The config information can be
  overridden on a per-control client basis.  See the example file for a list
  of all the items that can be configured.
