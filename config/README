This directory contains initialization configuration files used for the
various peices of the PSHELL package.  The following files and their use
are described as follows:

pshell-server.conf:
  This file contains configuration override information for all the PSHELL
  servers configured on a given host.  The startup information can be overridden
  on a per-server basis.

pshell-client.conf:
  This file is used by the PSHELL UDP Client program and the pshell.exp telnet
  'expect' script to assign server names to port addresses.  This can help in
  creating named servers without having to memorize port numbers.

pshell-control.conf:
  This file contains configuration override information for all the PSHELL
  control clients configured on a given host.  The startup information can be
  overridden on a per-client basis.
