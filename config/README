This directory contains initialization configuration files used for the
various pieces of the PSHELL package.  The following files and their use
are described below:

pshell-server.conf:
  This file contains configuration override information for all the PSHELL
  servers configured on a given host.  The startup information can be overridden
  on a per-server basis.  See the example file for a list of all the items
  that can be configured.

pshell-client.conf:
  This file is used by the stand-alone 'pshell' UDP Client program and the
  pshell.exp telnet 'expect' wrapper script to assign server names to port
  addresses.  This can help in creating named servers without having to memorize
  port numbers.  See the example file for the syntax of specifying port assignments.

pshell-control.conf:
  This file contains configuration override information for all the PSHELL
  control clients configured on a given host.  The startup information can be
  overridden on a per-control client basis.  See the example file for a list
  of all the items that can be configured.
