This directory contains Python versions of the PshellControl, PshellServer,
PshellClient (pshell.py), pshellAggregator, and PshellReadline functionality.
There are three demo Python programs in the 'python/demo' directory showing
their usage.  None of these files are copied/setup on a system wide install.
On a local install, environment variables are setup to allow access to these
files and modules.
