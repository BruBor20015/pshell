This directory contains Python versions of the PshellControl, PshellServer,
PshellClient (pshell.py), and PshellReadline functionality along with four 
demo Python programs showing their usage.  None of these files are copied/setup 
on a system wide install.  On a local install, environment variables are setup 
to allow access to these files and modules.
