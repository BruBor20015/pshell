This directory contains Python versions of the PshellControl, PshellServer,
PshellClient (pshell.py), and PshellReadline functionality.  There are four 
demo Python programs in the 'python/demo' directory showing their usage.  None 
of these files are copied/setup on a system wide install.  On a local install, 
environment variables are setup to allow access to these files and modules.
