.SH NAME
PshellControl - External Client Program Control of Remote PSHELL Server
.SH DESCRIPTION
This API provides the ability for an external client program to invoke functions
that are registered in a remote program running a pshell server.  This API will
only work on remote programs that are running either a UDP or UNIX pshell server.
.SH SYNOPSIS

#include <PshellControl.h>

/* on success, function returns valid Server ID (sid) to be used as input to other functions */

int pshell_connectServer(const char *controlName_,
                         const char *remoteServer_,
                         unsigned port_ = PSHELL_UNIX_SERVER,
                         unsigned defaultTimeout_ = PSHELL_ONE_MSEC*100);
                         
/* release resources for this connection */

void pshell_disconnectServer(int sid_);

/* issue remote command, function returns status of command */

int pshell_sendCommand1(int sid_, const char *command_, ...);
.br
int pshell_sendCommand2(int sid_, unsigned timeoutOverride_, const char *command_, ...);

/*
.br
 * issue remote command and extract results, function returns number
.br
 * of bytes extracted, must use non-0 wait time to extract results,
.br
 * extracted results is ascii formatted raw character data
.br
 */

int pshell_sendCommand3(int sid_, char *results_, int size_, const char *command_, ...);
.br
int pshell_sendCommand4(int sid_, char *results_, int size_, unsigned timeoutOverride_, const char *command_, ...);

The above synposis is just a summary of the most relevant part of the API,
