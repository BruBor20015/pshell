This directory contains bin, pkg and src for the 'go' implementation of the
PshellControl and PshellServer modules.  There are two 'go' demo programs,
go/src/pshellServerDemo/pshellServerDemo.go and go/src/pshellControlDemo/pshellControlDemo.go
None of these files are copied/setup on a system wide install.  On a local install,
environment variables are setup to allow access to these files and modules.
