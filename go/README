This directory contains bin, pkg and src for the 'go' implementation of the
PshellControl and PshellServer modules.  There are two 'go' demo programs,
pshellServerDemo.go and pshellControlDemo.go.  None of these files are copied/setup
on a system wide install.  On a local install, environment variables are setup
to allow access to these files and modules.  When switching between the full and
stub implementations, the 'go' demo programs must be rebuilt/relinked, since 'go'
is statically linked.
