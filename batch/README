This directory is used as the default directory for the batch files.
A batch file can contain one or more commands and can be sourced with
the built in command "batch".  The format of the commands are just as
they would be typed at the command line.

The batch processing will first look for the batch file in the directory
specified by the $PSHELL_BATCH_DIR environment variable, and if not found
will look in the default PSHELL_BATCH_DIR (i.e. /etc/pshell/batch), and if
still not found, will take the passed in batch file name verbatim.
