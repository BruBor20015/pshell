# This is an example startup file to send commands into a PSHELL server at
# server initialization time.  The format of the commands are just as they would
# be typed at the command line.  The startup file processing will first look for
# the file <serverName>.startup in the directory specified by the
# $PSHELL_STARTUP_DIR environment variable, and if not found will look in the
# default PSHELL_STARTUP_DIR (i.e. /etc/pshell/startup).  It will then execute
# all the commands before starting the server.
#
# Note that the naming convention of <serverName>.startup must be adhered to
# where <serverName> is the name that is used in the pshell_startServer call.
