This directory is used as the default directory for the startup files.
A startup file can contain one or more commands that are sourced during
startup and initialization of the given PSHELL server.  The format of
the commands are just as they would be typed at the command line.

The startup processing will first look for the file <serverName>.startup
in the directory specified by the $PSHELL_STARTUP_DIR environment variable,
and if not found will look in the default PSHELL_STARTUP_DIR (i.e. /etc/pshell/startup).

Note that the naming convention of startup file must adhere to the example
shown above, i.e. <serverName>.startup, where <serverName> is the name that
is used in the pshell_startServer call.

See the *.startup files in the 'startup' directory of this distribution package
for examples.
