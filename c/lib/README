This directory contains all the libraries included in this package.
It includes both .a and .so versions of all libraries for both static
and dynamic linking.  The pshell server libraries are also provided 
in full form and stub form.  The stub library honors the complete API
of the pshell server library, but with all the underlying functionality 
stubbed out.  This will allow for easy removal of all pshell functionality 
from an application without any application code changes or re-compiles.

These libraries are installed in the /usr/lib area on a system wide install.
